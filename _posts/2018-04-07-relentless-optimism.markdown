summary: In psychology class, they teach you about self-fulfilling prophecies. Here's the part they usually leave out: you can use it as a tool.

_This article first emerged as part of a larger conversation we had with Jun Shern. Read the full interview [here](/2012/04/07/conversations_2)!_

Throughout the years, I've had so many people tell me that I _"dream too big"_, or that I _"am too naive"_. It always annoyed me when they said that, because for all their concern, the only thing I hear when they said that is _"I don't believe in you"_. But I've never had a problem with believing in things, and thank god I didn't.

During my A-levels, my psychology teacher Mr. Loo taught us about something called the _self-fulfilling prophecy_. We read a case study about this experiment where a group of 100 students was split randomly into two classes of 50. They told the students that one of the (arbitrarily chosen) classes was the 'better' class and that the other class was the 'weaker' class.

After that, things went on as usual. Both classes had the same lessons, taught by the same teachers, and used the same facilities - there was no actual difference between the two classes except for the arbitrary 'better' or 'weaker' labels assigned to them at the beginning of the year. 

The study went on for some time, like maybe a year or so, the students sat for their exams, and then finally it was results day. The students obtained their exam results, and the researchers obtained their experiment results. You can see where this is going - I can't remember the exact details, but between the two classes, class labeled 'better' had obtained significantly better examination results than the 'weaker' class. 

When I first heard this story, I was shocked. I couldn't believe that an entire class of students did better, or worse, simply because they were told at the beginning that they were so. But the more I thought about it, the more it made sense.

> I couldn't believe that an entire class of students did better, or worse, simply because they were told at the beginning that they were so.

The labels, although arbitrary, were far from harmless. You tell a kid that he's a weaker student than that other kid, he's going to believe it. And as a consequence of that belief, he expects there to be a glass ceiling above his head, limiting how high he can reach - so he doesn't stretch himself that far. In a community, this is even more destructive. His teachers expect the class to be less capable - so they give them less advanced material, fewer rewards. The parents are disappointed that their child didn't make the better class, and the disappointment bleeds through to the kid, who may have been working hard all along but becomes even more disappointed in himself. This is clearly demotivating. 

Compounding all of this, the label becomes so much more powerful than just a label. **It becomes a prophecy.**

Knowing what we now know about self-fulfilling prophecies, can you see just how important it is to not listen to the naysayers? In the face of everyone trying to place different labels on you, you have to choose which labels you want to believe in. Because that belief, ultimately turns into actions, which turns into results. 

That's why if I have a choice of which prophecies I want to believe in, I choose to be relentlessly optimistic.
